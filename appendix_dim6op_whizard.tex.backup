\section{How to implement new vertices into \whizard}

Look up whether there is the vertex which consists of the same particles. 
If there is, you can just use it.
If not, you should define yourself. 

Type the new coupling coefficients into SM.f90 file.

\section{How to use the dimension-6 operators in \whizard}

here is an example for using 6 dimensional operatros.

Model: SM-6dim
