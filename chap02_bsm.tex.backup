Can I skip it?


\section{the Electroweak Precision Test}
% 
% One of the most successful achievement of the SM is the prediction and the measurement of SM gauge bosons. 
 
%  Although there is variation according to the renormalisation scheme, 
% Z boson mass is measured and very consistent with the value from theory. 
 
% In \mycite{Agashe:2014kda} \more{this is PDG}, Z boson mass is \unit[91]{GeV}, W boson mass is \unit[89]{GeV}?\\
% The weakmixing angle, the weak interaction coupling constant $g$ is $0.3$?.
And other values are shown in the \more{table:EWPT}. \\

The SM has been tested from several ineterations: polarization in $\beta$-decay, Muon decay, Pion decay, 
 Neutrion deep inelastic scattering, and etc.

 \paragraph{Precision test}
 As a known electroweak theory, the Standard Model has predicted many observables precisely 
and proved its validity by experiments. To fullfill this purpose the important quantity is 2-point function 
which is applied to describe the SM observables as well as to relate them to the quantity 
from the extension of the SM.
% at the LHC : polarization in $\beta$-decay \cite{Koks:1976zec}, Muon decay\cite{Bardon:1965sd}, 
% Pion decay, Neutrion deep inelastic scattering\cite{deGroot:1978feq}, and etc.
% Also, the experiments of $Z$ boson resonance via $e^-e^+$ annihilation has been performed with high accuracy not only to validate the SM 
% but also to suggest guide lines to beyond the SM sector. 
% To fullfill this purpose the important quantity is 2-point function 
% which is applied to describe the SM observables as well as to relate them to the quantity 
% from the extension of the SM.

The general expression of the Lagrangian related with the \emph{oblique} radiative corrections 
invariant under $U(1)_{em}$ symmetry is 
\begin{align}
 \cL_{V^2} = -\frac{1}{2}W_3^\mu \Pi_{33}(p^2) - W_3^\mu \Pi_{3B}(p^2) B_\mu 
 -\frac{1}{2} B^\mu \Pi_{BB}(p^2)B_\mu - W_+^{\mu}\Pi_{+-}(p^2)W_{-\mu}~, 
\end{align}
where $\Pi(p^2)$ is the vacuum polarization amplitudes at the tree level. 
Since this Lagrangian is formed based on the effective formalism, new effects from new physics
can be projected into it by parameterising the additional contributions.

 Assuming $q^2$ is small, the amplitude of the vacuum polarizations can be expanded as
 \begin{align}
  \Pi(p^2) ~=~\Pi(0)+p^2 \Pi'(0) + \frac{p^4}{2} \Pi''(0) + \cO(p^6). 
 \end{align}

 12 of observables are parametetrised from this Lagrangian. 
 Some of them are used for renormalisation of SM observables 
 and others are relevant to the BSM quantities.  
 These three fix the gauge kinetic terms $g,~g'$ and the mass of $W$ boson:
\begin{align}
 \Pi_{+-}'(0)~=~\Pi_{BB}'(0)~=~1, \nonumber\\
 \Pi_{+-}(0)~=~ -m_W^2 .
\end{align}

And from the fact that the photon is massless two more constraints are given:
\begin{align}
 \Pi_{\gamma\gamma}(0) = \Pi_{Z\gamma}(0) = 0 \nonumber
\end{align}

The remaining coefficients are expressed in terms of the oblique parameters
\mycite{Burgess:1993vc}
\begin{align}
\hat{S}=\frac{g}{g'}\Pi_{3B}'(0), ~~ \hat{T}=\frac{\Pi_{33}(0)-\Pi_{+-}(0)}{m_W^2},~~ 
\hat{U}=\Pi_{+-}'(0)-\Pi_{33}'(0),
\end{align}
\begin{align}
&V= \frac{m_W^2}{2}( \Pi_{33}''(0)-\Pi_{+-}''(0) )~,~~~~&X= \frac{m_W^2}{2} \Pi_{3B}''(0)~~~\nonumber\\
&Y= \frac{m_W^2}{2} \Pi_{BB}''(0) ~,~~ ~&W= \frac{m_W^2}{2} \Pi_{33}''(0)~~~ 
\end{align}
\more{MORE explanation for this}

The parameters $\hat{S}, \hat{T}$, and $\hat{U}$ are \mycite{Peskin:1991sw} 
\begin{align}
 S=\frac{4 s_W^2 \hat{S}}{\alpha_W},~~ T=\frac{\hat{T}}{\alpha_W},~~U=-\frac{4 s_W^2 \hat{U}}{\alpha_W}
\end{align}


% \more{What is EWPT(in what sense am I using \emph{EWPT}?)}\\
Also many parameters get compared to the observables and compatible results
from LEP experiments:
polarization in $\beta$-decay \cite{Koks:1976zec}, Muon decay\cite{Bardon:1965sd}, 
Pion decay, Neutrion deep inelastic scattering\cite{deGroot:1978feq}, and etc.
% Also, the experiments of $Z$ boson resonance via $e^-e^+$ annihilation has been performed 
% with high accuracy not only to validate the SM but also to suggest guide lines to beyond the SM sector. 
 Especially, $Z$ resononce via $e^+ e^-$ annihlation and $W$ mass measurement 
 pertmit to test sevaeral observables:
 forward/backward asymmetry from the processes $\to \ell\bar{\ell}$ or $\to f\bar{f}$,
 cross section at $Z$ pole, left/right asymmetry, and etc.
 Thess tests altogether usually are regarded as Electroweak Precision Tests(EWPT).

The Standard quantities for these days are \emph{Particle Data Group} \mycite{Agashe:2014kda}. 
\more{21 observables are used for testing Little Higgs models in this thesis 
and they will be shown in the Table somewhere. }


\paragraph{Naturalness ;; maybe this come after little higgs theory part}
To see how much the observables of the model is fine tuned, we need to define a quantity. 
There is no universal definition for the degree of fine-tunning, 
thus, we use the definition of \mycite{rkaniHamed:2002qy}. % littlest higgs cite
