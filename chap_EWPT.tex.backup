\section{Electroweak precision test in Little Higgs Model}
Little Higgs model is aimed at solving the hierarchy problem by the collective symmetry breaking
\mycites{Coleman:1969sm} and \cite{Callan:1969sn}.
Basically Little Higgs models have bigger group structure that the SM group is embedded in. 


Assuming $g_1$ and $g_2$ break each symmetry, $G_1$ and $G_2$, 
the Higgs will be left massless unless $G_1$ and $G_2$ are broekn collectively
because an unbroken symmetry protects Higgs mass term.
And the divergence contribution from the Higgs self-coupling would be logarithmic in the worst case.
The naturalness is guaranteed until $f \sim 4\pi v$.
