To have comprehensive view of the result plots, 
I need to discuss about topological aspects of LHT particle productions and decays.

\subsection{the production cross sections}
%\note{how the cross section get change w.r.t. the scenarios}\\
\more{Crosssectionplot} is production cross section plot with repect to $f$ and $\kappa$
where $\kappa~=~\kappa_q~=~\kappa_\ell$ in Fermion Universal model and $\sqrt{s}=\unit[13]{TeV}$. 
Since colour neutral fermions $\ell_H$ do not play a crucial role on the production processes,
the production cross section plot of Fermion Universal model and that of Light $\ell_H$ model 
are just alike.


As I mentioned before, all the cross sections of processes decrease as f increases. 
Only $q_H$ and $\ell_H$ are affected by $\kappa$ because only their masses depend on $\kappa$. 
$T^\pm$ have dependence on $R$ as well as $f$, 
but the cross section of the processes related with $T^\pm$ is flat in the $(\kappa, \sigma)$ plot.

Even though mass terms of $V_H$ depend only on $f$, we can find a small $\kappa$-dependence 
in the \more{$\kappa,\sigma$ plot} of Fermion Universal model. 
\more{It is because of contributions of $q_H$ in t-channel production of $V_H$ pairs,
which interfere destructively Drell-Yan-like s-channel vector boson diagrams. }

This effect is observed where $\kappa~\approx~0.5$ regardless to $f$,
which results in the fact that the production cross section of $V_H$ pair is less than 5 times
when $\kappa \approx 0.5$ in comparison to when $\kappa > 4$ and $q_H$ is decoupled. 
Also, in Heavy $q_H$ model, this effect disappears since $q_H$ are decoupled by construction. 


The production cross section values are roughly $10^3$ fb at most  
and we expect that the LHC can probe the parameter space sensitively 
in $\sqrt{s} = \unit[13]{TeV}$. 
Furthermore, the cross section is order \unit[$10^{-1}$]{fb} when $f\sim\unit[3]{TeV}$ and
we also can expect detectable event rate which were not the case for LHC Run 1 \more{ref.tonini thesis}. 


From all the cross section plots of the productions in the both plane $(f,\sigma)$ and $(\kappa,\sigma)$, 
it is clear that none of the processes is significantly high. 
Depending on the values of the points in the parameter space, 
the cross section relies on very different parameter 
and each process would have a diversity of final states.


When the $\kappa$ is small so that $q_H$ and $\ell_H$ get lighter, 
T-parity odd fermions are expected to be produced more. 
Thanks to the colour factor, the production rate of $q_H$ is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher
than that of $\ell_H$. Thus, $\ell_H$ becomes meaningful only when $f$, $\kappa$ are small 
such as $f \lesssim \unit[1]{TeV}$ and $\kappa \lesssim 0.5$

On the other hand, when $\kappa$ is large, 
the production of heavy vector bosons becomes important 
because their mass is independent of $\kappa$, which is different from that of T-odd fermions
$q_H$ and $\ell_H$ whose mass gets heavier and less produced. 
If $T^\pm$ is light, so it is experimentally accessible case, 
they will be produced as much as $V_H$. 
T-parity even vectorlike top $T^+$ is always negligible 
because $T^+$ is heavier than T-odd vectorlike top $T^-$.
