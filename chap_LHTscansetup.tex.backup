\section{ processes, reasons, production cross section, branching ratio}

\paragraph{processes with new particles}
We consider 6 processes for studying this model.  
\begin{enumerate}
\item $p p \rightarrow q_H q_H, q_H \bar{q}_H, \bar{q}_H \bar{q}_H$,
\item $p p \rightarrow q_H V_H$,
\item $p p \rightarrow f_H \bar{f}_H$
\item $p p \rightarrow V_H V_H$,
\item $p p \rightarrow T_+ T_+, T_- T_-$
\item $p p \rightarrow T_+ \bar{q}, \bar{T}_+ q, T_+ W^\pm, \bar{T}_+ W^\pm$
\end{enumerate}
% 왜 이 프로세스를 선택했는가. 이 프로세스의 특징은 무엇인가. ... 
These are regarded as the major production channels of LHT particles in the LHC.

Here, I will refer to T-parity o1d quarks, $u_H,~d_H,~c_H,~s_H,~b_H,~t_H$, as $q_H$; 
heavy gauge bosons, $A_H, Z_H, W_H$, as $V_H$; and
T-parity odd leptons, $e_H, \nu_H, \tau_H, \mu_H$ as $f_H$. 

For T-parity conservation, all of T-parity odd particles are produced in pairs. 
Among LHT particles, only $T_+$ introduced as a cancellon for Higgs-top loop divergence cancellation
can be produced in association with SM particles because $T_+$ is T-parity even like SM particles. 

\note{procduction crosssection plot.}
Their production cross sections are  monotone decreasing functions, 
which decrease with $f$ increaseing because
all of the particles' masses are proportional to $f$.  
% 왜 qhqhj은 없는지, 더블카운팅의 위험. T+- 의 질량에 영향을 미치는 R에 대해서도. 
% Heavy vector bosons are .... % 무슨말 하려고 했었지... ?? ㅋㅋ
% On the other hand, since T-parity odd quarks have mass terms also proportional to 
% another parameter $\kappa$, their production cross sections decrease with $\kappa$ increasing. 


\paragraph{Decay channels}
\note{Branching ratio} \note{Decay channel table}

T-odd quark $q_H$ decays into heavy gauge boson $V_H$ and SM quark, 
if the process is kinematically allowed. 
% and more into $W_H~q$ than $Z_H~q$ or $A_H~q$.
% because of electric charge
Although $V_H$ have several decay channels, under the such condition
the dominant decay is $A_H$ related ones 
like $W_H \rightarrow A_H W$, $Z_H \rightarrow A_H H$.  
If $A_H$ does not decay as the lightest T-parity odd particle,
the major final state of $q_H$ decay would be SM gauge boson and jets with the missing transverse momentum.
 
Regarding of $V_H$ they can also decay to $q_H$ and SM quark 
under the circumstance such as $M_{V_H} > M_{q_H}$. 
And $q_H \rightarrow A_H q$ decays are following. 
The major final state of the decay would be jets and the missing transverse momentum. 


Thus, the signals to test LHT are various and it is dominantly up to the mass of $q_H$.
So, We have studied this model with respect to the parameters:
the center of mass energy $\sqrt{s}$ , the symmetry breaking scale $f$ and 
the Yukawa coupling parameter of the extended LHT group $\kappa_q$, $\kappa_\ell$
% The procduction processes have a variety of final state 
% depending on the kinematical enviorenment and parameter scale. 




\section{Benchmark scenarios}

We have three benchmark models. These were considered to have insight into 
the aspects of the LHT particles with respecting to the model parameters: $f$, $\kappa_q$, and $kappa_\ell$

\subsection{Fermion universal model}
First, {Fermion universal model} has an assumption that the $\kappa_q$ and $\kappa_\ell$ are equal. 
We have scanned for the parameter space $(f,\kappa)$ where $\kappa~=~\kappa_q~=~\kappa_\ell$. 
% The $\kappa$s appears as the paramater of Yukawa coupling coefficients for the extended LHT group. 
Even if the T-odd fermion sector have the similar mass spectrum, 
the production cross section related colour-charged fermions is much larger than
that of the fermions colour neutral. 
% the particle with colour charge $q_H q_H$ productions are dominant because the colour factor enhance 
% even though 
The variation of $f$ makes change to the mass of LHT particles, 
while that of $\kappa$ has effects only on T-odd fermions mass. 
As in the \note{mass formulae for $V_H$ and $q_H$}, if the $\kappa$ is less than
$0.5$\note{need to check the exact value} it becomes true that $M_{V_H} > M_{q_H}$ and
$W_H$ and $Z_H$ decays are fermionic. 
Otherwise, $M_{q_H}$ gets heavier than $M_{V_H}$. 

\note{FINE TUNNING PROBLEM }; in the region where $f$ is ``small'', there is not so fine-tuned area. 
I want to talk about that too.

\subsection{Heavy $q_H$ model}
Second, {Heavy $q_H$ model} assumes T-parity odd quarks $q_H$ are heavier than T-parity odd leptons,
which results from fixing $\kappa_q = 4.0 $. 
as in the \note{mass formula ref.}, T-parity odd fermions mass terms are proportional to $\kappa_q,~ \kappa_\ell$. 
\begin{align}
 M_{u_H}=\kappa_q f ? , M_{d_H}= \kappa_q f \nonumber \\
 M_{\ell_H} = \kappa_\ell f 
\end{align}

With the larger value of $\kappa_q$, $q_H$'s mass is getting much heavier to muli-TeV-scale.
So, the $q_H$ is decoupled in the energy level where we looking at and 
it is not possible to detect them in the LHC, which makes the processes related with $q_H$
to play less important role. 
Thus, we can have insight for colour-neutral T-odd particles interactions.
% observe more impact from T-odd fermions $\ell_H$ except for $q_H$.



\subsection{Light $\ell_H$ model}
Lastly, for {Light $\ell_H$ model}, we fix $\kappa_\ell = 0.2$, which makes $\ell_H$ very light. 
This permits to decay into more lectonic state. 
Especially, heavy gauge bosons $V_H$ are expected to decay into $\ell_H$ and 
it would be interesting to observe how the bounds be changed from that of Fermion universal model.




\section{T-parity violation}
Until now, I took account of only the case that $A_H$ does not decay as the lightest T-odd particle 
thanks to T-parity conservation. 
As I mentioned in the previous Chapter,
from the gauge anomalies, it is possible to introduce the decays of $A_H$. 

As in the \note{formula}, $A_H$ can decay into $WW$ and $ZZ$. 
Also, taking loop-induced diagrams into account, fermionic decays can appear. 

\note{Feynman DIAGRAMS!!}

Although there are no more invisible particle assumed,
Supersymmetry motivated searches are expected to use for analysis for this model
because there are still the transverse missing momentum thanks to 
the leptonic decays, $\ell \nu$, of $W$ boson and the invisible decay, $\nu\nu$, of $Z$ boson.



\section{CheckMATE}
For testing this model, CheckMATE was used.
CheckMATE is an automatised program to test new physics at the LHC.
From \Feynrules model file, UFO model file, 
it can manage event generating, showering and hadronising by making use of \Madgraph, 
\Pythia and \Delphes. 

It determines the signal


\note{SHOULD rephrase the following}

For the main tasks of this numerical study, we make use of the collider analysis tool \Checkmate{} \cite{??}. 
This program is useful to test a given BSM model in an automatised way. 
It makes again use of the aforementioned  generator \Madgraph to simulate partonic events. 
By making use of the \texttt{UFO} model description file format, \Madgraph is able to 
simulate partonic events for a given BSM model which was implemented in a model building framework
 like \texttt{FeynRules} or \texttt{SARAH}. The showering and hadronisation of these events is
 subsequently performed by \texttt{Pythia8}, followed by the fast detector simulation \texttt{Delphes}
 which considers the effect of measurement uncertainties, finite reconstruction efficiencies 
and the jet clustering of the observed final state objects. 
These detector events are then quantified by various analyses from both \texttt{ATLAS} and \texttt{CMS} 
at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV (more details below). 
Events are categorised in different signal regions and \Checkmate{} determines 
which signal region provides the strongest expected limit. 
If the input model predicts more signal events than are allowed by the observed limit of 
that signal region, \Checkmate{} concludes that the model is \emph{excluded} at the 95\% confidence level, 
otherwise the model is \emph{allowed}. 
For more details on the inner functionality of CheckMATE, we refer to the manual papers in Refs.\cite{??}.
