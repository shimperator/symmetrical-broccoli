Because of renormalization conditions, 
the dimension of the Lagrangian of the Standard Model has 4 space-time dimension.

However, as considering the Standard Model as the low energy effective theory, 
we can build up higher-dimensional operators such as 5- and 6-dimensional operators.

\paragraph{the Hierarchy problem}

From the Lagrangian, the scalar particle or fermion can form loops 
which are quadratically divergent. 

For example, 
\begin{align}
 \cL
\end{align}





\paragraph{6-dimensional operators}

There are several expression for this operators.
